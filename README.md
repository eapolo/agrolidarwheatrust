## Installation & runnning the code

- The code use libraries well known. But check in your environment if you have all the libraries used in this code. Check in the folde ```inputs``` you will find the pcd files and in the folder ```outputs``` the csv files will be saved. Currently there is a test.pcd files can be used for testing purposed. 
- 
```
git clone https://github.com/eapolo/agrolidarwheatrust.git
cd agrolidarwheatrust
python converter.py
```


## Device

- The code converts PCD (Point Cloud Data) files into CSV format. The PCD files were captured using a Velodyne VLP-16 sensor. After data collection, all ROS bag files generated by the LiDAR sensor were processed and converted using specific ROS commands to extract and store the point cloud data in a structured format.



## Acknowledgements

- This code was developed to convert PCD files to CSV by adapting the pypcd4 code published at [https://github.com/MapIV/pypcd4/tree/main](https://github.com/MapIV/pypcd4/tree/main), ensuring it precisely meets our specific conversion requirements. We also want to express their gratitude to the [AGR-278; Smart Biosystems Lab](https://smartbiosystemlab.com/team/) research group for their un-wavering support throughout this study.
