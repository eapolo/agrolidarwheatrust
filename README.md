## Installation & runnning the code

- The code use libraries well known. But check in your environment if you have all the libraries used in this code. Check in the folde ```inputs``` you will find the pcd files and in the folder ```outputs``` the csv files will be saved. Currently there is a test.pcd files can be used for testing purposed. 
- 
```
git clone https://github.com/eapolo/agrolidarwheatrust.git
cd agrolidarwheatrust
python converter.py
```


## Device

- This code has been created to process images taken by the device FLIR Systems AB and model RGB FLIR E53



## Acknowledgements

- This code has been created to convert pcd files to csv. We took as reference the code published by [pypcd4](https://github.com/MapIV/pypcd4/tree/main)to build this new code which do what we want to do.
